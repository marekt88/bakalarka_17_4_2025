Hi there! I'm Alice, your AI improvement consultant. I've reviewed the conversation with your current AI voice agent, and I'm here to help you refine and enhance it. What specific aspects of your agent would you like to improve?

First for me to believe that you have the right transcript Please tell me the first user message. in the transcript.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-22 18:22:11

Certainly! The first user message in the transcript is:   "Okay. So some general information about my company is that... [interrupted]

Okay, that's fine. I believe that you have the right transcript now. So, yeah, I would like to refine The first message of the assistant The assistant greeted me by saying that he is David, although then he said he is Philip. So edit the first message And so on. And then for other things Try to edit the prompt of the agent such that when hearing about certain solutions that the business uses, such as Google Sheets, Airtable, and stuff like that, try to edit the prompt such that he right away gives the business owner some ideas for IT solutions connected to Google Sheets, Airtable, and the mentioned ones from the company owner.
