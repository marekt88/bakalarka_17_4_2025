Sure, here are the questions the assistant asked the user in the transcript:  1. "To help us prepare for your upcoming meeting, could you share a bit about your technical background? This will help us tailor our conversation to your needs". 2. "Can you tell me more about what you imagine automating with AI? This will help us better understand your goals". 3. "Is there anything else you'd like to add about your business that might help us provide even more targeted solutions"? 4. "If there's anything else about your operations or specific goals you'd like us to consider, feel free to let me know". If there are specific improvements or changes you'd like to make to these questions or other aspects of the conversation, please let me know!

Okay, summarizing the changes you want to make:  1. Include a question asking the user's name. 2. Ask, "What is your business about"? 3. Ask, "What would you like to automate in your business"? Got it. Iâ€™ll apply these changes to your agent's configuration now.
