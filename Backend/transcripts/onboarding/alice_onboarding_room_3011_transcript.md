Hello, I'm Mark and I would like to create an AI voice onboarding agent for my development company. Basically, this onboarding agent should start the conversation by introducing himself As an onboarding AI voice agent whose main purpose is to understand the potential in implementation IT solutions into the prospect's company And basically his main interaction will be with business owners who want to implement some IT solutions into the company. The flow of the agent should consist of asking questions to the business owner, general questions about some IT infrastructure of their company, and general questions about their company and about their processes. The goal of this agent is to understand the company and where is the potential for IT solutions. Basically, the overall goal is to gather context about the company of the prospect And to get information. Oh Alright, I think that's it.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-21 11:48:25

Thank you, Mark, for providing that insightful overview. From what you've described, your AI voice agent will function as an onboarding assistant aimed at understanding potential IT implementation opportunities within businesses. Its interactions will primarily be with business owners to gather context about their company's processes and infrastructure. Let's proceed step by step to ensure we cover all necessary details. Firstly, what would you like to name this AI voice agent? A name can add personality and make the interaction feel more personable for users.

### USER - 2025-04-21 11:48:36

The name should be David.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-21 11:48:56

Great choice! The agent will be called David. Now, let's talk about the persona and tone you would like David to have. Considering his role in onboarding and interacting with business owners, how should he behave? Would you prefer a formal and professional tone, or perhaps something more friendly and conversational? Feel free to describe the attitude you think would best suit these interactions.

### USER - 2025-04-21 11:49:07

Professional but very friendly.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-21 11:49:30

Got it. David will maintain a professional demeanor while being very friendly in his tone. This should help ensure business owners feel at ease and open to sharing information. Moving on to the voice characteristics, do you have preferences for David's tone, pace, and level of politeness during conversations? For instance, should his tone be warm and inviting, his pace slightly slower or faster than standard, and any particular politeness level?

### USER - 2025-04-21 11:49:47

The bass should be A bit faster so the onboarding process gets done quickly.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-21 11:49:59

Understood. We'll set David's pace to be a bit faster than standard to keep the onboarding process efficient. Now, in terms of language, will David be interacting in English, or are there other languages he should be equipped to handle as well?

### USER - 2025-04-21 11:50:09

Our English is all right.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-21 11:50:23

Perfect, David will communicate in English. Next, let's consider his response style. Would you prefer that David's responses be concise and to-the-point, or would you like them to be more detailed, possibly offering explanations or additional context where relevant?

### USER - 2025-04-21 11:50:35

I think this is enough context for the voice agent.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-21 11:51:05

Great, David will keep his responses concise and focused to ensure efficient information gathering. Now, regarding knowledge needs, does David require specific information or materials, such as scripts or topics, that he should be familiar with? For example, should he have access to any documents or guidelines that outline key questions about IT infrastructure and company processes? This will help ensure he asks the right questions and follows the correct flow.
