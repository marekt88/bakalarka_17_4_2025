Hello! I'm Alice, and I'll be your guide in creating your new AI voice agent here on the VoiceForge AI platform. My job is to ask you some questions to understand exactly what you need so we can build the perfect assistant for you. To kick things off, could you tell me: What will be the main purpose or primary goal of the voice agent you want to create?

Oh yes, so the primary goal is going to be an onboarding agent The goal of this agent is to ask three important questions. To the prospect to get more context before the actual online meeting with our development team. So I want the AI agent to first say: "Hello, I am David and I am here to ask you three questions." before the online meeting. Then after this first sentence, David, the onboarding voice agent, is going to ask these three questions. The number two is going to be What's your name of the business? And the number three will be Tell me about your daily processes that you encounter during your day. that are rather repeated and could be automated. David should just ask these three questions. And then He should end the conversation by telling the prospect that he will meet our developer soon He's thankful for taking the time. The prospect is taking their time of the day to answer these contextual questions. So that's it.
