Hello! I'm Alice, and I'll be your guide in creating your new AI voice agent here on the VoiceForge AI platform. My job is to ask you some questions to understand exactly what you need so we can build the perfect assistant for you. To kick things off, could you tell me: What will be the main purpose or primary goal of the voice agent you want to create?

### USER - 2025-04-24 11:13:05

OK, so the main purpose will be an AI voice agent which will act as Somewhat of an onboarding agent with the goal of Or getting some initial information before an online meeting with a potential client (with a prospect). Basically, this prospect schedules a call through our website. And right after he schedules a call Agent should call him with nice and friendly demeanor And Basically ask him three main questions. The first question should be what is his name? And the third question should be What or can he imagine to automate with AI So this is the main goal of the agent? And he should maybe spark a conversation with the client. Which then will be sent to our sales team who will have the online meeting with this client The The sales rep can then handle the call In a very efficient way.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-24 11:13:57

Great, thanks for sharing that detailed overview! Let me summarize to ensure I understand correctly:   You're looking to create an AI voice agent that serves as an onboarding assistant. It will call new prospects who schedule appointments through your website. The goal is to collect initial information that will help your sales team prepare for their meetings. The agent will ask at least three questions, starting with the prospect's name and ending with what they can imagine automating with AI. The agent should have a friendly demeanor and possibly spark conversation, with all the information gathered being sent to your sales team for efficient follow-up. Does that sound about right? Next, let's consider the agent's target audience. Could you tell me more about who this agent will typically be interacting with? For instance, are these mainly small business owners, tech-savvy individuals, or something else? This will help us tailor the agent's language and tone effectively.

### USER - 2025-04-24 11:15:06

Yes, so the agent should determine are business owners, but we should divide them into two groups. Ones are not tech savvy. Oh They are not developers, Them are quite good developers, so the agent should use his tone of voice This which determines if the prospect is Ah Developer or non-developer. So maybe use more technical jargon if the business owner sounds like a developer or if he uses technical jargon such as API?

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-24 11:15:41

Got it! So the agent will primarily interact with business owners, and it will need to identify whether they are developers or not based on their use of technical jargon. This distinction will help the agent adjust its tone and language—using more technical language with those who seem to be developers and a more straightforward approach with non-developers. Thanks for clarifying! Now let's move on to the desired persona or attitude of the agent. You've mentioned it should be friendly. Are there any other characteristics you'd like this agent to embody? For example, should it be empathetic, professional, enthusiastic, or perhaps a mix of these traits?

### USER - 2025-04-24 11:16:00

Yeah, let's make him more enthusiastic. to spark curiosity and to have energetic Attitude.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-24 11:16:23

Excellent choice! An enthusiastic and energetic attitude should help engage the potential clients more effectively and spark their curiosity, which is ideal for starting a meaningful conversation. Next, let's talk about the voice characteristics of your agent. Do you have preferences for the tone of the voice—should it be warm, authoritative, clear, etc. ? Additionally, how about the pace... [interrupted]

### USER - 2025-04-24 11:16:41

clear voice Ah Quite polite. and professional, but still very friendly and down-to-earth.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-24 11:16:57

Perfect, so we're aiming for a voice that's clear, polite, and professional while still being friendly and down-to-earth. This combination should create a welcoming yet credible persona for your agent. Now, regarding the language aspect, should the agent speak just English, or are there other languages it should support as well?

### USER - 2025-04-24 11:17:14

For now, English. But if someone talks to him in Slovak, he should Uh We play in Slovak.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-24 11:17:32

Understood. The primary language will be English, but the agent should have the capability to switch to Slovak if a prospect initiates the conversation in Slovak. Now, regarding how the agent should respond, would you prefer responses that are concise or should they be more detailed, offering context or additional information when needed?

### USER - 2025-04-24 11:17:44

The responses must be very concise.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-24 11:18:09

Great, we'll ensure the agent keeps its responses very concise to maintain a clear and efficient flow during conversations. Now let's discuss the knowledge and information aspect. Besides the initial questions we've already covered, does the agent need specific scripts or additional knowledge about your company's offerings, policies, or any other specific topics? This will help us ensure it can handle the discussions accurately and target the right information.

Lastly, are there any specific opening or closing lines, or key phrases that the agent must use during its interactions? These could include greetings, introductions, or ways to wrap up conversations effectively.
