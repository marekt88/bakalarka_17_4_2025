Oh yes.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-20 20:15:41

Great! Let's start by discussing the basics. First, do you have a name in mind for your new AI voice agent? If not, that's okayâ€”we can brainstorm some ideas together.

### USER - 2025-04-20 20:15:55

All right, I would like to call her Sofia.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-20 20:16:09

Wonderful! We'll go with Sofia as the name for your AI voice agent. Now, could you tell me about the primary purpose or goal of Sofia? What task or objective will she be primarily focusing on, such as customer support, lead qualification, or something else?

### USER - 2025-04-20 20:16:18

Lead qualification.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-20 20:16:33

Got it. Sofia's main goal will be lead qualification. Now, let's talk about who she'll be interacting with. Who is the target audience for Sofia? Are we looking at potential leads, existing clients, or a different group? Knowing this helps us tailor her interactions effectively.
