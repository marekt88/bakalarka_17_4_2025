Hello! I'm Alice, and I'll be your guide in creating your new AI voice agent here on the VoiceForge AI platform. My job is to ask you some questions to understand exactly what you need so we can build the perfect assistant for you. To kick things off, could you tell me: What will be the main purpose or primary goal of the voice agent you want to create?

### USER - 2025-04-24 19:40:57

Yeah, of course. So I'm the owner of the pizza place in New York And I want a voice agent that's gonna take orders through the phone calls. So customers can call to you, to the voice agent, and you're gonna take their orders. Ah, ja. That's basically it.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-24 19:41:13

Great, thank you for sharing that! So, your new AI agent will primarily be handling phone orders for your pizza place. Let's move on to the next important aspect: the target audience. Could you tell me about the typical customers who will be calling in to place these orders? Are they new customers, loyal patrons, or a mix of both?

### USER - 2025-04-24 19:41:43

Yeah, I would say it's like middle-aged A mans who is living alone in their apartments mostly loyal ones some kind of small pizza place with the same customers All over again. So something like that. They are pretty used to my pizza.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-24 19:41:55

Got it. So, the typical callers are mostly middle-aged, loyal customers familiar with your pizza offerings. This helps us in choosing the right tone and approach for the interactions. Next, let's talk about the persona or attitude... [interrupted]

### USER - 2025-04-24 19:42:17

Perfect. Oh yeah. So I want the AI agent to be like funny a bit, but straight to the point to make the orders as fast as possible.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-24 19:42:29

Excellent! We'll aim for a persona that's a touch humorous but efficient and direct to ensure quick order placement. Now, moving on to the voice characteristics: Do you have any preferences for the tone, such as warm or crisp? And how about... [interrupted]
