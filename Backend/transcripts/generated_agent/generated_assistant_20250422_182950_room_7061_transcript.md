Great, thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you have quite a specialized operation. Could you tell me a bit more about the size of your company and your core business operations? For example, how many people are involved and what your day-to-day processes look like?

### USER - 2025-04-22 18:28:27

We are a team of five people. First I sit down to my computer and I go through all the websites of our competitors to see what are they doing and posting like new blog posts and stuff like that. Then I go to their Facebook and Instagram pages to see what new products are they selling and stuff like that. Then I look at our blog posts and try to create new Instagram, Facebook posts For our followers to see our activity.

Thank you for detailing your daily operations. It sounds like you're heavily involved in marketing and staying updated with industry trends. To streamline this, have you considered using tools that can automate competitor analysis or social media management? Platforms like Hootsuite or Buffer might help manage your social media posts effectively, while tools like BuzzSumo can aid in monitoring competitor activity. How does your current IT setup support these tasks?

### USER - 2025-04-22 18:29:06

Oh yeah, we just do it manually.

### ASSISTANT - 2025-04-22 18:29:26

That's understandable, especially in a smaller team setup. Automating some aspects of your process could save you a lot of time and effort. If you pair automation tools with your existing setup, you could focus more on strategic aspects rather than repetitive tasks. Would you be interested in exploring some specific solutions that could simplify things for your team?

### USER - 2025-04-22 18:29:35

Yeah, for sure.
